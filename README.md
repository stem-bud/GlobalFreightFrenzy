## Forking the Repository

In order to maintain secrecy among contestants, we will be using GitHub for submissions and enforcing contestants to 'fork' the repository and then 'submit' their work by creating a PR against the main branch.

1. Fork this repository on GitHub

- Go to https://github.com/Meta-Logic-Corp/GlobalFreightFrenzy
- Click **Fork** in the top-right corner
- Create the fork under your own GitHub account

2. Install Git LFS

```bash
git lfs install
```

3. Clone your fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/GlobalFreightFrenzy.git
cd GlobalFreightFrenzy
```

4. Add the original repo as `upstream`

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Meta-Logic-Corp/GlobalFreightFrenzy.git
git remote -v
```

5. Create a feature branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-change
```

6. Commit and push your changes to your fork

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your change"
git push -u origin feature/my-change
```

## Creating a Pull Request

1. Open your fork on GitHub and switch to your branch.
2. Click **Compare & pull request**.
3. Set:

- **base repository:** `Meta-Logic-Corp/GlobalFreightFrenzy`
- **base branch:** `main` (or the target branch requested by maintainers)
- **head repository:** your fork
- **compare branch:** `feature/my-change`

4. Add a clear title and description of what changed and why.
5. Click **Create pull request**.
6. Respond to review feedback by pushing additional commits to the same branch.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug, simulation inconsistency, or unclear behavior, please open an issue in the main repository:

https://github.com/Meta-Logic-Corp/GlobalFreightFrenzy/issues

When creating an issue, include:

1. A clear title that describes the problem.
2. Steps to reproduce the issue.
3. Expected behavior vs. actual behavior.
4. Relevant logs, error messages, or screenshots.

## Example Step Function

Filename: example_step.py

## Writing a custom `step` function

```python
# my_strategy.py
from simulator import VehicleType

def step(sim_state):
    """Called by the simulator every tick."""
    tick     = sim_state.tick
    vehicles = sim_state.get_vehicles()   # read-only snapshot
    boxes    = sim_state.get_boxes()      # read-only snapshot

    if tick == 0:
        # Create a semi-truck at the Los Angeles hub
        vid = sim_state.create_vehicle(VehicleType.SemiTruck, (33.9425, -118.4081))

        # Load boxes that are at this location (costs 1 pt each)
        nearby = [bid for bid, b in boxes.items() if b["location"] == (33.9425, -118.4081)]
        sim_state.load_vehicle(vid, nearby)

        # Drive toward New York
        sim_state.move_vehicle(vid, (40.6413, -73.7781))

    for vid, v in vehicles.items():
        # When the truck arrives, unload boxes destined for this location
        if v["destination"] is None and v["cargo"]:
            loc = v["location"]
            to_drop = [bid for bid in v["cargo"] if boxes[bid]["destination"] == loc]
            if to_drop:
                sim_state.unload_vehicle(vid, to_drop)
```

## How to Validate Your Step Function

Run with an external strategy script that exports `step(sim_state)`:

```bash
./logic-transport-sim /absolute/path/to/my_step.py --ui
```
